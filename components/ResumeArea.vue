                  We've worked on a number of travel insurance brands. The

                  come with having multiple locations. We worked with our

                  Building brand awareness is one of the most important
                  investment for the FMCG industry. If you're in this industry,
                  it is likely that your customers make purchase decision
                  implusively. Therefore, it is crucial to present your brand
                  ahead of that decisive moment to cut through the competive
                  market. We can help you build your brand through unique
                  content creative, search engine optimisation, social media
                  management and other awareness-oriented advertising platforms
                  such as Google Display, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and more.

                <p>
                  Gambling is a classic example of a B2C business. Decisions are
                  implusive, it is important to maximise value from a customer
                  and the more your invest in marketing the more return you get.
                  High-valued customers are not so easy to come by, therefore, a
                  strong customer retention program is necessary as it is much
                  more expensive to acquire a new customer in such a competitive
                  market. Moreover, because there's a lot of competition,
                  investing in organic channels such as YouTube, Facebook,
                  Instagram and SEO is also advantageous to lower the reliant on
                  paid advertising.

                <p>
                  While the health industry is challenge due to many
                  restrictions major platforms such as Google and Facebook,
                  there are also one of the most exciting industry due to the
                  increasing demand. Similar to the fitness industry, customers
                  make decision based on familiarity, credibility and proximity.
                  Familiarity and credibility can be achieved by building
                  awarness for your brand which is something we have been
                  helping our clients achieve for the past years. While
                  proximity isn't something we have control over, we can ensure
                  that your brand is visible and is present at the right place
                  and time.

                  As a professional service provider ourselves, we know how hard
                  it is to build trust with our prospects. Offering unique
                  services to distinguish yourself is a crucial part to be
                  successful in this industry. However, by simply showing up
                  when prospects research about your services, you're already
                  better than most of your competitiors. Your website or other
                  means to provide more information about your brands (i.e.
                  social media pages) also need to be comprehensive and have a
                  strong lead generation focus. In such a competitive and
                  high-engagement industry, a subpar website or Facebook page
                  will not be enough to build trust.

                  Your target audience will determine the best channel for you
                  to invest. Again, it is important to show up once you've
                  determined your effective channels. Most of the time, the
                  common channels are Google Search, both paid and organic.
                  People research their options heavily before making a
                  decision. Ideally you want to be present to accomodate
                  prospects along their decision-making processes through
                  remarketing and awareness channels.

                  The tourism is exciting and inspiring to work on. Our team
                  loves travelling and adventure and we often get holiday ideas
                  from working with our clients and seeing the upcoming offers.
                  Unlike other industries, the tourism industry is more about
                  generating desire than about responding to people's needs.
                  Especially, if your brand is location specific, if you appear
                  after someone's booked their ticket or accommodation, it's too
                  late. Therefore, to be successful in this industry, you need
                  to generate engaging content and have a killer customer
                  database.

                  Most of the B2C businesses face the same challenge. They're
                  targeting to minority of the population, not just business
                  owners that need their services but ideally looking for the
                  services. Construction is one of the hardest industries to
                  advertise for due to the extremely limited audience size.
                  Therefore, the best strategy is to be present at the research
                  time, this means dominating Search Ads (Google Ads & Bing
                  Ads), search engine optimisation (SEO) and Google Maps.

                  Similar to the construction industry, winning in search ads,
                  and SEO is extremely important. Investing in engaging content
                  is also important as business owners/decision makers often
                  continuously seek advice on management, finance or tax topic.
                  So, investing in content and build awareness in credible
                  placements (blogs, websites, apps or influencers) will
                  complement your advertising effort as your brand becomes more

                  Getting people to change to your brand is challenging industry
                  as it is hard to distinguish from other competitors. Purchase
                  decision is also extrememly price driven. Similar to other B2B
                  industries, visibility is important. Therefore, investing in
                  Google Ads and SEO is crucial to becoming successful. The tip
                  is to appeal to people who may be unhappy with their current
                  provider. This is achieved by posing engaging questions in
                  your content and adverts to get the prospects thinking about
                  their current situation. Then, it's time for you to offer a

                <p>
                  After working with multiple Not-for-Profit organisations, we
                  know how hard it is to get donations. You may or may not know
                  that charities are eligible to get USD$10,000 grant from
                  Google to spend on Google Search ads. Many charities are
                  struggling to utilise this opportunity effectively.
